        Through distant planes, again you've come to me
        Standing tall and proud, enveloped by a dark shroud
        Your visage, was it hair or snakes living?
        Eyes dark as coal, into my soul, they're peering

        Such terror, such fear, I could not stand to be near
        Frightened, I closed my eyes and wished not to see
        Turned my back to you, to scream, to flee
        But even with my eyes closed, I saw yours looking back at me

        Sahte enli amar
        Sahte enli amar

        Never averting her gaze, flaming eyes gleaming with vigor,
        to me it was a trigger

        Memories future and past, every moment that was us

        It flashed: Before time, was you and me
        every touch, taste, smell and sound,
        to you forever has made me bound

        Your mind, soul and body, the only I've ever known

        Sahte enli amar

        As I stood up and turned to face you
        Fear was there no more. Replaced by longing
        Pressing your lips against mine, a familiar moment
        Divine

        Sahte enli amar
        Sahte enli amar
        Sahte enli amar

        I am with you, echoed through our mind
