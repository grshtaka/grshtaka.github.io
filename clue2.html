        The battle, locked still
        Neither side with a moving will

        In that moment, decision was his
        To plunge unto chest the sword of ishis
        Witch such actions things were set into motion
        Divine beings thrown into commotion

        Eyegaze upon the thread unveiled
        Three rushed into battle with no moment to spare
        He and she adored the awe

        With no words coming from his mouth shut
        Throught every valley, treee and rock
        Even the sky above overlooking
        With his voice in all, shuddered

        Her eyes frozen in fear
        To no avail is escape near
        Gentle breeze upon the desert dunes
        Every touch, poison or blessing as such

        His hand her mind
        Her soul his heart
