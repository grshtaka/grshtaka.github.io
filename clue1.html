        As the four stood silent to each one.
        Their looks intertwined.

        The land reached it's hand for the skies.
        Not a breath to spare, the depths had given to the chase.
        Racing one another, who will be the first to wonder.

        Celestial dome came down for the show.
        One being split into two.

        Each facing their own reflection, looking in.
        They've began to sing, countless others joined in.

        A chorus so powerful, so loud.
        Structure so violent, so profound.

        In their nooks and crannies they/ve birthed a new mind.
        Resting upon others safe and sound.
