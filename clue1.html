        As the four stood silent to each one
        Their looks intertwined

        The land reached it's hand for the skies
        Not a breath to spare, the depths had given to the chase
        Racing one another, who will be the first to wonder

        Celestial dome came down for the show
        One being split into two

        Each facing their own reflection, looking in
        They've began to sing, countless others joined in

        A chorus so powerful, so loud
        Structure so violent, so profound

        In their nooks and crannies they/ve birthed a new mind
        Resting upon others safe and sound
